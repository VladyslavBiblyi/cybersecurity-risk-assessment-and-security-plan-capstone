# VFMC Cybersecurity Risk Assessment & Security Plan

This project is a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment and security plan developed for Valley Forge Military College (VFMC).
The analysis follows a structured risk-management framework, incorporating guidance from federal cybersecurity standards and 
industry best practices. The work includes evaluation of organizational, process, and technology risks, along with actionable 
recommendations to strengthen VFMC’s security posture.

## Project Overview
The security plan was created in alignment with the CS290 Capstone Project requirements and models real-world consulting work. 
It evaluates existing controls, identifies vulnerabilities, and proposes improvements across multiple domains, including:

- **Risk Management**
- **People & Policy Risks**
  - Organizational policy  
  - Legal & regulatory compliance  
  - Personnel security & training  
- **Process Risks**
  - Operational risks  
  - Physical security  
- **Technology Risks**
  - Network security  
  - Platform security  
  - Application/software risks  

These categories follow the structure outlined by the VFMC ISS Cyber Security Plan Template and Capstone Instructions.  

## Key Contributions
- Conducted a full cybersecurity risk assessment based on interviews, documentation review, and best practices.
- Analyzed threat vectors, vulnerabilities, and campus-wide operational challenges.
- Provided strategic recommendations for access control, training, policy enforcement, infrastructure security, and incident response.
- Authored the Process Risks section and contributed to overall plan consolidation.

## Files Included
- **VFMC Cyber Security Plan (PDF)** - full written assessment  
- **Reference materials** used during analysis (FCC Cyber Planner, USF IT Plan, etc.)  
- **Capstone Instructions** - defining scope and required domains  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Organizational security assessment  
- Risk identification and prioritization  
- Policy and compliance evaluation  
- Technical and physical security analysis  
- Incident response planning  
- Collaborative report development  
- Alignment with NIST-inspired frameworks and best practices  

This project reflects real-world cybersecurity consulting work and demonstrates the ability to apply structured security frameworks to a live organizational environment.
